%% -- SECTION: 8: description.tex
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% -------------  Detailed description of the patent  --------------- %%
%%
%% NOTES:
%%  - Describe how the invention is made and how it works referencing
%%    the drawings.  Charts and tables can be included in the text of
%%    the application but are kept separate as drawings.
%%  - Start with a 'birdseye' paragraph that names the major
%%    components and a short phrase after each describing their
%%    functions.  Identifying those components with even reference
%%    numbers, starting with the number 10 to identify the preferred
%%    embodiment.
%%  - Number the parts chronologically (in 'drawings/features.def') 
%%  - Describe each of the major components in separate paragraphs
%%    after the birdseye paragraph.  Refer the reader to the drawing
%%    FIG. that best shows that component.
%%  - Typically, description of how the inventions works is found
%%    after the description of the structure (although embedding this
%%    information during the description of the structure might be
%%    easier for certain inventions).
%%  - The application as a whole must show how to MAKE and how to USE
%%    the invention.  If both of these are not clearly expressed, the
%%    Patent Office may reject the application.
%%  - Some examiners can be very 'dense' - it is best to add language
%%    pertaining to how, when, and where your invention is to be used.
